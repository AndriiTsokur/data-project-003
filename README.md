# Analyzing Used Car Listings on eBay Kleinanzeigen
We will be working on a dataset of used cars from _eBay Kleinanzeigen_, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data) (not available anymore). The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points including simulating a less-cleaned version of the data.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

__The tools used are:__
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

The step-by-step milestones and final result are shown [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/AndriiTsokur/data-project-003/blob/main/exploring_ebay_car_sales_data.ipynb)
